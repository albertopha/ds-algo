Problem Statement:
There are ‘N’ tasks, labeled from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’. Each task can have some prerequisite tasks which need to be completed before it can be scheduled. Given the number of tasks and a list of prerequisite pairs, write a method to print all possible ordering of tasks meeting all prerequisites.
